# Godot Roguelike Template

A template base game for a roguelike (dungeon crawler) written in Godot 4. Includes:

- Procedural animation when entities move (slide) from tile to tile
- Monsters and the player don't step on each other's spots or converge on the same spot simultaneously
- The player can move faster than monsters (more turns per one monster turn) or vice-versa
- Fog of war: undiscovered tiles are dark until explored once
- Sample art!

This is a work-in-progress, which I intend to add to as I introduce more "basic" common roguelike features.
